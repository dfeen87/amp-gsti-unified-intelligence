# AMP-GSTI Assumptions & Limits  
## Modeling Boundaries for v1.0.0

This document outlines the assumptions, constraints, and limits of the AMP-GSTI system to support responsible use and accurate interpretation.

---

## Economic Assumptions

- Macro trust signals are meaningful at aggregate levels
- Regime classification captures broad economic conditions, not short-term noise
- Goodwill is modeled as an emergent macro signal, not a moral judgment

---

## Talent Modeling Assumptions

- Skill vectors are anonymized and abstracted
- Scores represent **relative merit**, not absolute human value
- The system supports decision-making, not decision replacement

---

## Regime Classification Limits

- Regimes are coarse-grained by design
- Transitional or mixed regimes may reduce confidence scores
- Classification does not predict future market movement

---

## Simulation vs Reality

v1.0.0 includes simulation tooling for:

- Candidate generation
- Market signal population
- Aggregate analytics

These simulations are:
- Deterministic
- Non-persistent
- Intended for validation and experimentation

---

## Explicit Exclusions

- Behavioral inference
- Psychological profiling
- Identity-based trust scoring
- Automated hiring or rejection

---

## Validation Status

- Logic paths are unit-testable
- Outputs are explainable
- External empirical validation is an ongoing research objective

---

## Appropriate Use

AMP-GSTI is designed for:
- Research
- Decision support
- System experimentation

It is **not** designed to replace human judgment or institutional governance.
